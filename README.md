# 📘 About this project
This project analyses employee attrition data to explore patterns, diagnose factors impacting attrition, predict attrition risk using Python and provide recommendations for business. 

## 📂 Data Sources
The dataset used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset]. 
This is a synthetic dataset with 1470 data samples and 34 columns.

## 🔍 Key Questions to be answered
1. How does employee attrition vary across employee groups (by deparment, gender, job level, tenure,...)? Are the differences statistically significant?
2. What are significant factors that make differences between the group that stayed vs left?
3. Are the significant factors affecting attrition statistically different across different demographic groups (i.e department, job level). Can these insights inform targeted intervention for a specific group?
4. What features are most predictive of attrition risk? What is accuracy of prediction model using Logistic Regression?
